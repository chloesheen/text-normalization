File I/O and Text Normalization

### Speech Synthesis and Recognition:

The file i/o program reads in the file and reports how many characters, words, and lines are in the file. 

Using the FST class, the text normalization program builds an FST that converts color names in minidictionary.txt into their
phonetic representations.

The tokenization program takes a text and parses it into sentences based on general rules with punctuation, abbreviations, and other grammatical rules.
